# Week 1 - 3 October 2024

## Goals

### Literature Review :heavy_check_mark:

Find and summarize some research papers (2 or 3 promising ones), about how to crop/rectify to reshape QR code and remove artifacts.
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640
- https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2631-8695/acb67e/pdf

Create a few slides for presenting the literature and what can be used.

### Determine CNN Archetecture and Method to Adopt :heavy_check_mark:

Have some options, maybe with one I would prefer to pick. It needs to be:
- An architechture I understand
- Relatively small and efficient
- Easy to do transfer learning with

## Outcome of Week

Decided on:
- Trying out pretrained YOLO models on MAN ES provided dataset
- Finding a python library for non-rigid deformable transformation (bending cylinder shape etc.)
- Train non-pretrained YOLO on kaggle dataset to see how it performs
- See if YOLO pretrained on different datasets exists and compare

# Week 2 - 10 October 2024

## Goals

### Data Annotation :heavy_check_mark:

Annotate MAN ES provided dataset according to YOLO architecture. Model is predicting [x,y,W,h] of bounding boxes.

### YOLO models :heavy_check_mark:

Find (and download) some different pretrained YOLO models.

Also set up pipeline for training untrained YOLO models.

### Evaluation Metric :on:

Decide upon an evaluation metric. Will likely be a simple metric like accuracy, as false positives should not be likely with Data Matrix decoding.

## Outcome of Week

TBD

# Week 3 (October Break)

# Week 4 - 24 October 2024

## Goals

### Experiment 1 :x:

This week will focus on performing the first experiment with the chosen model and our two datasets.

The outcome of this experiment will decide if we need to make any changes or if we can continue.

## Outcome of Week

TBD

# Week 5 - 31 October 2024

## Goals

### Feedback :x:

Implementation of any changes based on feedback from previous weeks outcome.

### Post-processing :x:

Possibility to add any post-processing such as restoration techniques etc.

## Outcome of Week

TBD

# Week 6 - 7 November 2024

## Goals

### Experiment 2 :x:

This week will focus on performing the second experiment with any new models / additions to the previous pipeline.

## Outcome of Week

TBD

# Week 7 - 14 November 2024

## Goals

### Report Writing :x:

Bulk writing of report.

## Outcome of Week

# Week 9 - 28 November 2024

## Goals

### Initial Report Due :x:

Veronika will be reading research paper reports on 5th December. Submit initial version of report before then so that she can read and give feedback.

## Outcome of Week

TBD

# Week 10 (Backup) - 5 December 2024
