# Week 1 - 3 October 2024

- What helped you this week?
- What did you achieve?
- What did you struggle with?
- What would you like to work on next week?
- Where do you need help from Veronika?
- What are the agreements after this meeting?

## Goals

### Literature Review :x:

Find and summarize some research papers (2 or 3 promising ones), about how to crop/rectify to reshape QR code and remove artifacts.
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6958902
- https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2631-8695/acb67e/pdf

Create a few slides for presenting the literature and what can be used.

### Determine CNN Archetecture and Method to Adopt :x:

Have some options, maybe with one I would prefer to pick. It needs to be:
- An architechture I understand
- Relatively small and efficient
- Easy to do transfer learning with

## Outcome of Week

TBD

# Week 2 - 10 October 2024

- What helped you this week?
- What did you achieve?
- What did you struggle with?
- What would you like to work on next week?
- Where do you need help from Veronika?
- What are the agreements after this meeting?

## Goals

### Data Annotation :x:

Annotate MAN ES provided dataset according to chosen model architecture. Model could be predicting dots, coordinates, a mix...

### Source Dataset (for transfer learning) :x:

Find and prepare a public dataset (containing any DM code like images) for the bulk training of the chosen model. This will be ~90% of the models training process.

We will later finetune the model to the MAN ES provided dataset.

### Evaluation Metric :x:

Based on previous papers choices, decide upon an evaluation metric. Will likely be a simple metric like accuracy, as false positives should not be likely with Data Matrix decoding.
