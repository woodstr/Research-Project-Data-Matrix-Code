# Week 1

## Goals

### Literature Review

Find and summarize some research papers (2 or 3 promising ones), about how to crop/rectify to reshape QR code and remove artifacts.
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6958902
- https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2631-8695/acb67e/pdf

Create a few slides for presenting the literature and what can be used.

### Determine CNN Archetecture and Method to Adopt

Have some options, maybe with one I would prefer to pick. It needs to be:
- An architechture I understand
- Relatively small and efficient
- Easy to do transfer learning with

## Outcome of Week

TBD

# Week 2

## Goals

### Data Annotation

Annotate MAN ES provided dataset according to chosen model architecture. Model could be predicting dots, coordinates, a mix...

### Source Dataset (for transfer learning)

Find and prepare a public dataset (containing any DM code like images) for the bulk training of the chosen model. This will be ~90% of the models training process.

We will later finetune the model to the MAN ES provided dataset.

### Evaluation Metric

Based on previous papers choices, decide upon an evaluation metric. Will likely be a simple metric like accuracy, as false positives should not be likely with Data Matrix decoding.

# Week 3 (October Break)

# Week 4

## Goals

### Experiment 1

This week will focus on performing the first experiment with the chosen model and our two datasets.

The outcome of this experiment will decide if we need to make any changes or if we can continue.

## Outcome of Week

TBD

# Week 5

## Goals

### Feedback

Implementation of any changes based on feedback from previous weeks outcome.

### Post-processing

Possibility to add any post-processing such as restoration techniques etc.
